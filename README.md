# Bike-Sharing
# Surfs Up Analysis
Surf and Ice Cream Shop Analysis for our friend W. Any for the location on Oahu

## Purpose
####
The purpose of this assignment is to analyze data from NYC Citibikes in order to ascertain the feasibility of opening a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. We need to use our data to create vizualizations in Tableau that contribute to our analysis and our pitch to the investors.

## Analysis
#### To understand the differences between June and December, I have provided graphs of both months data below. The first being June and the second being December.
> Since this is an Ice Cream and Surf Shop, the activities are commonly understood to be enjoyed in warmer temperatures. Therefore I am going to use warmer as an indicator of the significance of temperatures throughout the month.

> We also need to understand that W. Any did not give us any criteria for determining the significance of both June and December, and if we are comparing them against eachother or comparing them against the year on average. 

> Before we begin our analysis, we should gather the data and charts at our disposal. We have put together histograms and descriptive statistics for both June and December. We should use the charts to observe any obvious behaviors, and reference the descriptive stats to support/reject our hypothesis.

#### 2 additional queries I would run to analyze more data for the analysis
    1. A query to analyze the precipitation data by date and by station.
    2. A query to analyze the distribution of the data by station, because location even on a small island could play a large role in this.

#### What would help complete this analysis?
* We need to know a little more about the data, when throughout the dat were these temperatures recorded? Is it the average of the whole day? Were there other factors that could have significantly contributed to the average that should be considered outliers? Current events like a hurricane?
* I would like to have criteria in analyzing, but because we have no context, we can only make an informed assumption at this point.
* I would want to see data for January and February to compare, if the reason for the analysis was "trying to compare the peak of summer to the pit of winter". Those to me would seem to be the 2 coldest months that I would want data on to determine if we could be open at all those 2 months. June is also not the hottest month in many places, with July or August taking that award.
* I would also want to see the precipitation data for the dates and also the time of day. We know that temperature follows the basic patter of peaking in the afternoon and bottoming out after midnight in most places around the world. Precipitation in my environment is seemingly random, but I do know that in certain climates around the world it also extremely consistent. Regardless of its assumed distribution, it could be a very helpful addition to this analysis.
