# Bike-Sharing
# Surfs Up Analysis
Surf and Ice Cream Shop Analysis for our friend W. Any for the location on Oahu

## Purpose

#### 2 additional visualizations I would like for further analysis
    1. A chart that shows the lifecylce of a bike. The average number of people that touch it a day, and how long it is ridden until its serial number no longer records rides.
    2. I would want to see the subscriber repeat ratio. How many times an individual rides in a given month, quarter and year.
