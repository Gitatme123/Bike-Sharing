# Bike-Sharing
In order to propose our Bike-Sharing program to investors, we must prepare an analysis for one of our key stakeholders. In this challenge we analyze the vizualizations we've created in order to uncover significance and to answer key questions.

## Purpose
####
The purpose of this assignment is to analyze data from NYC Citibikes in order to ascertain the feasibility of opening a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. We need to use our data to create vizualizations in Tableau that contribute to our analysis and our pitch to the investors.

## Results
#### The following graphs and charts contribute

1. The first graphic we see here is the total number of unique bikes being used in NYC currently. This number represents every unique Bike ID with at least one data point for "Starting Time". This is quite a few bikes, but without supporting data, it doesn't mean much more than just the total bikes used in circulation during the time period the dataset was taken from.

2. The 2nd graph we are looking at is a breakdown of users by gender, listing the total as well as the % of total. It is clear that males make up the majority of the users, at 65%. This chart can be used in comparison to the average time a user uses a bike for by gender to determine significance.

3. The 3rd graph shows us the number of trips a single bike is taken on average during this window of time. It looks like quite a few bikes aren't used at all. It also looks like a large number of bikes are used quite a bit, but not too many times. It looks like on average a bike is used about 300 times, but we would need more supporting data to draw significance from this.

4. The 4th graph shows us check out times for subscribers vs. non-subscribers. The immediate value I see here is that at its peak, there are about 830% more subscribers using the bike at once than non-subscribers. The business must be working well to have that many subscribers, signalling to me that the system is used for more than just tourists. The locals would therefore make up the majority of users.

5. The 5th graph shows us the average trip time broken down by gender. It is clear Men use the bikes for a longer amount of time than women do.

6. The 6th graph shows us trips by weekday by hour.

7. The 7th graph shows us a breakdown of startitmes by gender.

8. The 8th graph shows us user trips by gender by weekday by usertype.

9. The 9th graph shows us a cluster map of startimes with circle size and location denoting the concentration of data to that specific point. The obvious takeaway here is that the big hubs are by other transportation sources. Without putting more layers onto this map, its hard to tell the significance, especailly because Des Moines is nothing like NYC lol!

#### High Level Summary
* My conclusion is that 


#### 2 additional visualizations I would like for further analysis
    1. A chart that shows the lifecylce of a bike. The average number of people that touch it a day, and how long it is ridden until its serial number no longer records rides.
    2. I would want to see the subscriber repeat ratio. How many times an individual rides in a given month, quarter and year.
    3. I would want to see a visualization for the different months of the year that bikes are utilized. As this analysis required us to create breakdowns by weekday, I think bringing in an analysis by month would be equally as important.
